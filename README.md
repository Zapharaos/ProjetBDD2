# ProjetBDD2

Implementation of a database for a website of recipes. It was realized within the framework of a project in the fifth semester of my bachelor's degree (2021).

This project is divided in two parts :
- the first one is about creating the database and inserting data (located in src/part-one).
- the second one is about implementation using requests, functions, procedures, triggers and index (located in src/part-two).
